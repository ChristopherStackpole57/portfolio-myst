## Froglet Studios
#### Game Development Intern
October 2025 - Present

**Overview** \
I contributed to real-time rendering systems and shader development within
a Unity production environment, focusing on performance scalability and
pipeline integration. 

**Responsibilities**
- Designed and implemented custom HLSL and ShaderGraph shaders to produce
procedural geometrical effects
- Optimized shaders performance to scale across scenes containing tens of
thousands of rendered objects.
- Developed a C# inegration pipeline to automate shader attachment, parameter
binding, and runtime value computation.
- Collaborated with engineering team to ensure visual fidelity met
performance contrainsts.

#### Computer Science Specialist
June 2025 - Present

**Overview** \
I worked on AI model evaluation and failure analysis within software
engineering domains, focusing on correctness, edge-case detection, and code
quality assessment.

**Responsibilities**
- Stress-tested AI systems by constructing complex, novel, and edge-case
software engineering scenarios
- Reviewed and corrected AI generated code for correctness, clarity, and
conformance to software engineering best practices
- Authored structured prompts modeled on real-world schemas to evaluate
reasoning depth and architectural understanding
- Provided technical feedback to improve model robustness in software
engineering contexts.
