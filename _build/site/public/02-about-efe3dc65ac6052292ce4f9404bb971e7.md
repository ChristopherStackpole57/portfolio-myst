## Core Philosophy
I believe string software behaves like a well defined physical system: deterministic, internally consistent, and governed by
invariants.

In Rendering and Simulation work I prioritize:
- Deterministic state transitions
- Clear data ownership and memory boundaries
- Explicit synchronization
- Transparency and performance over abstraction

I am particularly interested in building systems from first principles -- understanding *why* an API  works, not just *how* it
works.

## Bookshelf
A selection of texts that have influenced my approach to graphics development and engine architecture:
- Game Engine Architecture, Jason Gregory, 3rd Edition
- GPU Gems 3, NVIDIA Corporation & Hubert Nguyen
- Seven Languages in Seven Weeks, Bruce Tate
- Analytical Mechanics, Fowles & Cassidy, 7th Edition
