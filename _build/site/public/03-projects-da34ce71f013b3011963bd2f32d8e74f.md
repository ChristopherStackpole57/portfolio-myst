:::

**Overview**
VRENDER is a real-time Vulkan rendering engine. This project emphasizes
control and configurability.

**Technical Overview**
- Driven my modern Vulkan techinques, such as: Dynamic Rendering, Local
Read, Bindless Descriptors, Sychronization2, and VMA
- Custom geometry allocation and suballocation system for static and
dynamic mesh streaming
- Cross-Platform and Cross-Vendor window abstraction supporting GLFW,
SDL, SFML, and Win32
- Custom CMake build system

**Technologies**
C++20, Vulkan, VMA, GLFW, SDL, SFML, Win32

```

**Overview**
Archimedes is a custom math engine built to support rendering and physics
engines. The library emphasizes performance, clarity, and deterministic
behavior.

**Technical Highlights**
- Template driven engine types, such as: vectors, matrices, and quaternions
- Header only implementation, massively simplifying engine integration
- Conformance test suite enforcing correctness

**Technologies**
C++11, DocTest
