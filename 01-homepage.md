### Rendering & Physics Engineer

**A Little About Me**

I am a graphics and physics focused engineer with a strong interest in real-time
rendering, simulation, and engine architecture. My work centers around building 
dynamic rendering systems from first principles -- implementing math libraries, memory management techniques, and GPU pipelines in modern APIs like Vulkan and OpenGL -- as well as physically accurate rendering with techniques like Fresnel and Fourier shaders.

I approach software the same way I approach physics: a deterministic set of
constraints and invariants that must maintain internal consistency. This perspective
influences how I design rendering pipelines, memory management, cross-device
synchronization, and simulation code.

I am currently working on a Vulkan based rendering engine focusing on:
- Modern Vulkan features (Dynamic Rendering, VMA, Synch2, Boundless Descriptors)
- Cross-platform compatibility
- Modularity and top-level configurability
- GPU-driven architecture \

My goal is to work on rendering engines, graphics drivers, or real-time GPU driven
simulations where performance, correctness, and architecture matter.

**Tech Demo**

Below is a short demo highlighting recent rendering and engine work. The footage
demonstrates custom engine systems including geometry streaming, transient mesh
support, and a conformance test driven math abstractions.
